**About the project**

Robbery, warfare and the mass export of production equipment to the Third Reich and the USSR seriously weakened Poland's economy after World War II.

Economic plans in the People's Republic of Poland included increasing the number of investments and industrialization of the country along the lines of the USSR, including mainly the development of heavy industry, followed by the development of light industry and agriculture.

Too much investment in heavy industry resulted in the production of products that were not in demand. The centrally controlled economy and the destruction of the private sector ultimately led to the deterioration of the quality of life of citizens in the country.

To prove this thesis, the presentation will look at how during the various economic plans in Poland (after 1960 - data available from the World Bank (The World Bank)) how foreign exports and imports looked, the education of citizens, birth and death statistics, and how Poles migrated , including leaving the country.
